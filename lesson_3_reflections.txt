Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

May not always have internet connection---???

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

fork: create a copy of github repo to github repo
clone: create copy of github on local machine
branch: create a copy of commit
