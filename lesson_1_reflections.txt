was introduced?

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

 Easy to switch to previous version
 Easy to find mistakes introduced in new version

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

-The new version need not be consistent
-May not be a logical change
-Auto saving is helpful if you forget to save/batter discharges


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Can have related changes in several code files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

   cd into the git repo 
   type git log to obtain the list of updated
   find the id of the commit with the required message
   use git diff old_id new_id to get the changes

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

It allows us to find the mistake /revert to older version
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I would like to use it in my android app projects(showing pollution)
